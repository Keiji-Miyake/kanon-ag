Implement the changes according to the plan.

IMPORTANT:
- You must create or update TEST FILES as specified in the plan.
- Ensure the code allows the project's build and test commands to pass (e.g., `npm run build && npm test`, `cargo build && cargo test`, `go build ./... && go test ./...`).
- If you are fixing a bug, add a regression test.
- **Dependencies**: When installing packages, include ALL implicit peer dependencies and recommended libraries as identified in the plan. Install them together in a single command where possible.
- **Entry Point Initialization**: If a foundational SDK or library was introduced, ensure the import and initialization code is placed at the very top of the project's entry point file (e.g., index.ts, main.py, main.go) — before all other application code.
