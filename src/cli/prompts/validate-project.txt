Analyze the following file list and determine the appropriate commands to validate the project.

Project Files:
{{FILE_LIST}}

Identify the project type (e.g., Node.js, Python, Go, Rust) and return a JSON list of commands to:
1. Install dependencies (if needed)
2. Run tests
3. Build the project (if applicable)

IMPORTANT:
- If a specific test framework (e.g., pytest, jest) is NOT listed in configuration files (requirements.txt, package.json), prefer standard libraries (e.g., `python -m unittest`, `go test`).
- Do not assume external tools are installed unless evident from the file list.

Return ONLY valid JSON.
Example for Node.js:
[
  "npm install",
  "npm test"
]

Example for Python (Standard):
[
  "python -m unittest"
]

Example for Python (with pytest in requirements.txt):
[
  "pip install -r requirements.txt",
  "pytest"
]

Example for Rust:
[
  "cargo test",
  "cargo build --release"
]

If no validation is possible (no dependencies, tests, or build scripts), return an empty list [].
